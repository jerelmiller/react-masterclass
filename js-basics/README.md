# JavaScript Basics

Here you will find some examples for some basic JavaScript concepts. To be a
successful React developer, I find it helpful to have a solid understanding of
JavaScript itself.

## Setup

There is no setup for this example. Simply follow the "Running the examples"
section to run the examples

## Running the examples

This example includes a very basic HTML file that includes the 3 JS files in
this example folder. Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser. Open the
JavaScript console to see output from the examples.

Since many of the examples use `console.log` to teach a concept, you may find it
very noisy if you are trying to look at a single concept. In fact, several
examples intentially blow up to teach a concept. Feel free to comment out any
examples you do not want to run.
