# Props

Props are the bread-and-butter of React components. They are how you communicate
from one component to another. Think of props like arguments to a function. They
allow you to pass input from one component to another.

Here you will learn the basics of rendering your first React component, what
the `React` and `ReactDOM` packages are used for, and how to use your components
together to create an app.

## Setup

Ensure you are in this directory

```
$ cd props
```

Install dependencies

```
$ yarn
```

Start the app

```
$ yarn start
```
